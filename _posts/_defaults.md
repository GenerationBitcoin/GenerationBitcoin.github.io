Hey, this is the default post, you can write whatever post you want to add to the website in markdown, and submit the PR.

You should include a title and a category, which will appear as a tag, so that people can find posts more like the ones you've written.

You can include your name or alias is the staff member section. 

The date should be formatted as year-month-day, for example 2016-07-20. 

The title of the file should be formatted as date first, and then the title in lowercase, for example 2016-07-20 my thoughts on bitcoin.

Happy writing!
